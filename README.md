# TVGenerator

Testvectors Generator uses the commercial Verific library to generate testvectors containing random binary values. The resulting tv file is used by TestBench generator to create testbenches for verification.
Example Testvector file generated by TVGenerator:

```javascript
# Ports:
#		INPUT	|	OUTPUT 
clk, reset, enable,  | count[3], count[2], count[1], count[0]

000XXXX
1101111
0010011
0000110
1011101
1101001
1100001
0011010
1111001
1001101
1111110
#	End of testvector file! 

```
Since the Verific library is a commercial source that is paid for, it is not included here. For information about the Verific Verilog parser and library, see www.verific.com. 


## Build
Open the provided .pro file in QTCreator and run the build.
Tested and built in Windows 10, it should open and convert without problems in Linux.
For a successful build, you need the full source code of Verific.
Under Linux, after opening the .pro file, a full Makefile is written, which can also be built with the make command.
## Usage

```javascript
Usage: Auto Testbench generator:
        -i            <input Verilog IP file>
        -testvec      <Output testvectors file>
        -vecNumber    <generated testvectors number>

```


## Test
Located in the test_designs folder is a simple counter written in Verilog HDL. 
You can see the sample exported tb file in tb.v.
The example test-vector file is test_vecs.tv.
## Run test
```javascript
TVGenerator -i ..\test_designs\counter.v  -testvec ..\test_designs\test_vectors.tv -vecNumber 10
```
